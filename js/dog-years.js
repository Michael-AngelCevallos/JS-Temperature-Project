/** Dog Years
// Dogs mature at a faster rate than human beings. We often say a dog’s age can be calculated in “dog years” to account for their growth compared to a human of the same age. In some ways we could say, time moves quickly for dogs — 8 years in a human’s life equates to 45 years in a dog’s life. How old would you be if you were a dog?
//
//     Here’s how you convert your age from “human years” to “dog years”:
//
// The first two years of a dog’s life count as 10.5 dog years each.
//     Each year following equates to 4 dog years.
//     Before you start doing the math in your head, let a computer take care of it! With your knowledge of math operators and variables, use JavaScript to convert your human age into dog years. */


/* Create a variable named myAge, and set it equal to your age as a number. */
let myAge = 29;

/*Create a variable named earlyYears and save the value 2 to it. Note, the value saved to this variable will change.*/
let earlyYears = 2;

/* Use the multiplication assignment operator to multiply the value saved to earlyYears by 10.5 and reassign it to earlyYears.*/
earlyYears = earlyYears * 10.5;
console.log(earlyYears);
